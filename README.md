# OPS102-Operating-System


## Why OS is needed ?
- If my system has not any OS then just think about the scenario like - when you launch the tiktok app that time it takes the permission of direct accessing the CPU, memory, GPU, disk.So it can hack your system if there is not any layer between the app and hardware parts to communicate.
- Also, tiktok is using 90% CPU,80% memory here so i am not able to play PUBG game because there is not running space for it.
-  The example of running TikTok on a device illustrates the basic hardware components required (CPU, memory, GPU, disk) and the need for resource management.
-  OS prevents one application (like TikTok) from monopolizing all resources by implementing resource management, allocating specific percentages of resources to different applications.
-  like **INTERFACE** - interface is like a bridge between two things that need to work together here app and hardware
<br/>

- **Application software** performs specific task for the user.like email,,game  
- **System software** operates and controls the computer system and provides a platform to run application software.like windows,ios

## OS - operates the system
- An operating system is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer system,both hardware and software, and provides an environment in which the user can execute his/her programs in a convenient and efficient manner by hiding underlying complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.
- Collection of system softwares

## what does OS do
### hardware abstraction
- hardware means os can access hardware + abstraction means hiding
- middleman between your computer's hardware and the software you use
- Hides the underlying complexity of the hardware. (Aka, Abstraction)
- OS hide the details of hardware like memory,gpu,cpu,usb,blutooth,screen,keyboard from the application software
- ex. here application software can get input from keyboard without knowing how it is connected so apps have no information about hardware
- ex. apps can send data through internet for api calling here apps have no idea that internet is conencted with ethernet, wifi, 5g-4g connection

### Resource Management - Arbitration
- (memory, device, file, security, process etc)
- Without an OS, developers would need to manage memory and resource allocation manually, leading to redundant code and bulkier applications.
- OS prevents one application (like TikTok) from monopolizing all resources by implementing resource management, allocating specific percentages of resources to different applications.
- The example of running TikTok on a device illustrates the basic hardware components required (CPU, memory, GPU, disk) and the need for resource management.
